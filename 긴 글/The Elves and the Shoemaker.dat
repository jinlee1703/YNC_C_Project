The Elves and the Shoemaker
 There was once a shoemaker, who, through no fault of his own, became
so poor that at last he had nothing left but just enough leather to
make one pair of shoes. He cut out the shoes at night, so as to set to
work upon them next morning; and as he had a good conscience, he laid
himself quietly down in his bed, committed himself to heaven, and fell
asleep. In the morning, after he had said his prayers, and was going
to get to work, he found the pair of shoes made and finished, and stan-
ding on his table. He was very much astonished, and could not tell
what to think, and he took the shoes in his hand to examine then more
nearly; and they were so well made that every stitch was in its right
place, just as if they had come from the hand of a master-workman.
 Soon after, a purchaser entered and as the shoes fitted him very well
he gave more than the usual price for them, so that the shoemaker had
enough money to buy leather for two more pairs of shoes. He cut them
at night, and intended to set to work the next morning with fresh
spirit; when he got up they were already finished, and a customer even
was not lacking, who gave him so much money that he was able to buy
leather enough for four new pairs. Early next morning, so that he was
soon in the way of making a good living, and in the end became very
well to do.
 One night, not long before Christmas, when the shoemaker had finished
cutting out, and before he went to bed, he said to his wife,
 "How would it be if we were to sit up tonight and see who it is that
does us this service?"
 His wife agreed, and set a light to burn. Then they both hid in a
corner of the room, behind some coats that were hanging up, and then
they began to watch. As soon as it was midnight they saw come in two
neatly-formed naked little men, who seated themselves before the shoe-
maker's table, and took up the work that was already prepared, and
began to stitch, to pierce, and to hammer so cleverly and quickly with
their little fingers that the shoemaker's eyes could scarcely follow
them, so full of wonder was he. And they never left off until everyth-
ing was finished and was standing ready on the table, and then they
jumped up and ran off.
 The next morning the shoemaker's wife said to her husband, "Those
little men have made us rich, and we ought to show ourselves grateful.
With all their running about, and having nothing to cover them, they
must be cold. I'll tell you what: I will make little shirts, coats,
waistcoats, and breeches for them, and knit each of them a pair of
stocking, and you shall make each of them a pair of shoes."
 The husband consented willingly, and at night, when everything was
finished, they laid the gifts together on the table, instead of the
cut-out work, and placed themselves so that they could observe how the
little men would behave. When midnight came, they rushed in, ready to
set work, but when they found, instead of the pieces of prepared
leather, the neat little garments put ready for them, they stood a mo-
ment in surprise, and them they testified the greatest delight. With
the greatest swiftness they took up the pretty garments and slipped
them on, singing,
 "What spruce and dandy boys are we!
 No longer cobblers we will be."
 Then they hopped and danced about, jumping over the chairs and ta-
bles, and at last danced out at the door.
 From time to time they were never seen again: but it always went well
with the shoemaker as long as he lived, and whatever he took in hand
prospered.
