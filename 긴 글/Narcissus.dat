Narcissus
 Long, long ago, there lived in Greece a young boy named Narcissus.
All day long he tended his sheep in the hills, and drove them from
place to place to find the very best pasture.
 One day he came to a little stream and wanted to drink from it. The
water was very clear and reflected everything that leaned over it.
 While Narcissus was waiting for the sheep to drink, he chanced to see
his own face in the water.
 He had never seen his likeness before, and he was so pleased with the
pretty picture that he looked at it for a long time. He forgot all
about his sheep.
 The sheep waited for a long time near stream, but at last they wander-
ed away without the shepherd and were lost.
 Jupiter, the great god of that country, was very angry with Narcissus
for forgetting his sheep, and made up his mind to punish him.
 So Narcissus looked at himself very long, and when he turned to look
after his flock he found that his feet had taken root.
 He could not move nor lift his head, but had to keep it hung down.
 Then, little by little, he changed into the flower that we know so
well, the narcissus. This is why we often find this dainty flower
growing on the banks of streams and always with its pretty head hung
down.
